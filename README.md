## About The Project

<img src="https://github.com/SelyanSel/WindowsCopilotActivator/blob/main/preview.png?raw=true">

Was tired of going into registery editor and manually activate copilot each time i wanna use it. So i made this quick and easy tool to use copilot with just a shortcut on your desktop.

2. Launch the application
3. Pin the app in your taskbar (right click on the Copilot icon in your taskbar, then pin)

Installation is done!

## Usage

To use Copilot, once pinned to taskbar, it is fairly simple.

2. Press Activate Copilot
3. The app should close. Now, when you press on the Copilot logo in your taskbar, Copilot should pop up!

To close the app, go into your Icon Tray in your taskbar, double click on the copilot logo and press Disable copilot.
